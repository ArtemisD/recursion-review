// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:
// var parseJSON = JSON.parse;

// but you're not, so you'll write it from scratch:
var parseJSON = function(json) {
  // your code goes here


  //Go through the array character by character.
  //Break string up by commas (push into an array). TODO: Explore using Split
  //Break the string into {} or [] chunks and push to an array.
  //Define obj type for each chunk and create the needed

  //Feels like we need to break this in half

  //FINAL RESULT: Turn passed in string to an obj/arr that contains different obj types
